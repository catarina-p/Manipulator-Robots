# Manipulater Robots
## Part 1
In the scope of the curricular unit Manipulater Robots (taught at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico), this work consists in the analysis of the UR5 robot from Universal Robots.
The focus of this part of the project is on the Kinematics analysis of the robot, namely, concepts of Direct Kinematics, Geometric Jacobian matrix and the effect of singularities, Inverse Kinematics, and Closed-form solution.

## Part 2
In the scope of the curricular unit Manipulation Robotics, this project consists in the analysis of the UR5 robot from Universal Robots.
The focus of this report will be on the analysis of dynamics and control of the manipulator.
Firstly, an estimation of the physical properties of the robot was done, and then the Newton-Euler formulation was used to obtain the gravitational dynamics, the mass matrix and the fictitious force vector for the manipulator.
To control the robotic arm, a decentralized controller and a centralized inverse dynamics controller were implemented.
The performance of these controllers was tested when a trajectory is applied to the manipulator.
